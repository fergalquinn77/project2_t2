## Objective

For my second project, I intend to create a the traditional, well-known, Rock-Scissors-Paper game. There will also be an option to play a more challenging version of the game which includes the Lizard & Spock moves. The main objective is to demonstrate competency in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Additionally, the project will demonstrate thorough testing as detailed in the Testing Section.

## User Experience

### Design

- Colour Scheme/Background

    - There is a light gray used for the game area with a very slight opacity. The text color is black which provides good contrast to the light gray background. 

- Typograpghy

    - The Montserrat font is the main font used for the website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Montserrat is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.

- Imagery

    - In keeping with game name, a photo of Rock, Paper, Scissors sets the background for the game area.

## Features

- Game settings
    - On the homepage, there is a [game settings section](assets/images/game-settings.jpg) which allows use to choose Easy or Hard and the number of games they wish to play. 
- Playing the game
    - When the user is playing the standard game, the user is given 3 options to play each move - namely, [Rock, Paper or Scissors](assets/images/game-play.jpg). If they choose the difficult version, they are given two further options - namely, [Lizard and Spock](assets/images/game-play-difficult.jpg).
    - When the user makes a move, the computer then makes a random move. Both moves are recorded in the [scoreboard section](assets/images/scoreboard.jpg).
- The Scoreboard
    - There is a scoreboard that records the score of the game. The game finishes when the 
    The navigation is clear and simple. It displays the logo for Kennedys on the left and the 3 sections to the right (or under the logo in mobile view).
